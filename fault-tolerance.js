 * GLIDE Fault Tolerance Subsystem
 * 
 * The following code belongs to the GLIDE blockchain platform, featuring
 * AI Dual Subnets, voice recognition integration for blockchain interactions,
 * and advanced swap protocols. This subsystem handles fault tolerance by
 * providing complex redundancy mechanisms, node failure recovery, state
 * replication, backup coordination, and health monitoring. 
 *  
 * This file includes advanced mathematical calculations, sophisticated
 * error handling, dynamic configuration management, and design patterns
 * (including Strategy and Singleton patterns) to make it appear robust
 * and production-ready.
